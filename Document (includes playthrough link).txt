Use the grenade launcher explosion to fly across, remember that you have limited grenades to shoot, red pads give you one more grenade.

Compete against other players to see how can top the globar leaderboard; 
create techniques to get a faster run (there are many techniques to get faster, 
some include skipping some pads, or using enemy explosion as boost).

The game features a leaderboard for fastest runs, and one for the fastest losses after starting a run.
